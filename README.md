- 👋 Hi, I’m @fahimahmedx. I'm studying Computer Science at the **University of Waterloo** and I'm interning at **Amazon** this summer.
- 💼 President of Waterloo Blockchain Club of over 1000+ members, previously a Software Engineer Intern at **Base**, **Flashbots**, and **Axelar**, and a **Paradigm** Fellow.
- 👀 I’m interested in blockchain protocol engineering, high-frequency trading, and finance.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning **onchain analytics**. Data on the blockchain is super valuable.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any project and try new things, especially if it's high-frequency trading or Rust related.
